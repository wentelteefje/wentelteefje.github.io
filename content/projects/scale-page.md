SCALE (Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian) is the data format for types used in the Parity Substrate framework. It is a light-weight format which allows encoding (and decoding) which makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained execution environments like blockchain runtimes and low-power, low-memory devices.
